    "## Unique Email Address\n",
    "\n",
    "Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  For example, \"alice.z@leetcode.com\" and \"alicez@leetcode.com\" forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)\n",

    "You are given an integer array A. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\n",

    "You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that A[i] <= A[j] and A[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\n",
    "During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that A[i] >= A[j] and A[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\n",
    "It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.\n",

    "A[4] that is greater or equal to A[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\n",
